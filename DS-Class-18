# Local and Global variables in functions
# Difference Between Local and Global Variables:

Rules for Local Variables :
===========================
   Local variable we should Define inside a function only.
   Only accessible within that function.
   Disappears once the function has finished executing, so it cannot be used outside the function.

Rules for Global Variables :
============================
   Global varaible we can Define outside of all functions.
   Accessible from any part of the program, including inside functions.
   If modified inside a function, you must use the global keyword to indicate that you’re working with the global variable.

Example 1: Local Variable :
===========================
code-1 :
--------
# The variable we provided inside a function we can call it as local variables
def addition():
    n1=10     # Local variables 
    n2=20     # Local variables
    add=n1+n2 
    print("The addition of {} and {}".format (n1,n2,add))
addition()
code-2 :
-------
def example_function():
    local_var = 10  # This is a local variable
    print("Inside the function, local_var:", local_var)
example_function()
# Trying to access local_var outside the function will give an error
# print(local_var)  # This will cause an error because local_var only exists inside the function

Explanation:
------------
   local_var is created inside the function and only exists there.
   If you try to access it outside the function, you’ll get an error because it doesn't exist outside.
Code-3:
-------
# Local variables we can't print outside the functions until unless we return the value
def avg():
    num11=10     # Local variables 
    num22=20     # Local variables
    num33=30     # Local variables
    avg=num11+num22+num33/3
    print("The avg of {},{} and {}".format (num11,num22,num33))
    return(num11) # it'll return/store the values of num11
val1=avg
addition()

Example 2: Global Variable :
=============================
Code-1 :
--------
# The variables which we provided outside a function we can call it as a global variables
n1=10
n2=20
def addition(): # No need to provide values on inside the fucntion, The function will automatically take the values from global varaibles which we mentioned on above.
    add=n1+n2
    print("The addition of {} and {}".format (n1,n2,add))
addition()

Code-2 :
--------
global_var = 20          # This is a global variable
def example_function(): 
    print("Inside the function, global_var:", global_var)
example_function()
# You can access global_var outside the function as well
print("Outside the function, global_var:", global_var)

Explanation:
------------
   global_var is defined outside the function, making it a global variable.
   It can be accessed both inside the function and outside.
