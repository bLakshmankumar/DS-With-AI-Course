ANACONDA PROMPT:
================
  Every windows laptop has CMD Prompt and Powershell
  In the same way when we install anaconda in our laptop. Anaconda is also having it's own anaconda command prompt, Anaconda powershell and Anaconda App/Navigator.

Simply :
========
  When we install Anaconda we will get 3 things.
   1 > Anaconda Navigator/App which is in Green colour.
   2 > Anaconda Prompt it's similar to laptop command prompt.
   3 > Anaconda Powershell.

Process to use the anaconda :
=============================
   On your laptop search bar type/search with anaconda (there we can see the anaconnda cmd prompt, Anaconda App/Navigator and Anaconda powershell options.
   > Now choose/click on the anaconda navigator option ( which means open the app).
   > Once we launch the app, it'll take 1-2 min of time to load and open.
   > Once it opens there we can see many tools ot softwares like jupitor, vsc, pycharm & many. 
   > If we observe here Few tools have "Launch" option and Few tools have "install" option.
   > So if any tool you want to use, then first choose the install option then choose the launch option.
   > Exmple i want to open the jupytor notebook from anaconda app. Here i have launch option, So once i click on the Launch option then it'll open the jupytor notebook on browser.
   > Create a new Folder for isolate the practice : Ex : I created a dswithanaconda folder on Downloads path.
   > Then Go to that path on jupytor, Then on top right choose the new option > Choose Notebook Option > It'll redirect to noteboook page on new tab > Choose python3(ipykernal) and click on select.
   > Now here we can practice the python code. And if we see the previous tab of jupytor page we cann see the new file was created with .ipynb extention(This is the extension for jupytor notebook).
