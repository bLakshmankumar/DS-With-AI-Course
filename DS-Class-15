Functions :
===========
  Functions means "Reuse any part of code".
Rules of a functions :
======================
  def <function-name> : Functions start with def and we need to provide function name.
  def <function-name> (): Function means () and : is necessary [Whenever column is come what is the next, intendation will come].
Example :
=========
   def <function-name>():
       # Write your code here
   function_name() # call the fucntion it'll execute the code 
  
Dive into code for functions :
==============================
Code-1 without functions :
--------------------------
Write a basic code for doing addition
   n1=10
   n2=20
   add=n1+n2
   print("the addition of {} and {} is {}".format(n1,n2,add))

Code-1 with functions :
-----------------------
Now we will impliment the "functions on this addition code"
   def addition ():
       n1=10
       n2=20
       add=n1+n2
       print("the addition of {} and {} is {}".format(n1,n2,add)) # If you execute this function it'll not give any output, The output will not display until unless we call a function.
   addition() # Now execute the code, It'll call that addition function and execute the code inside that addition function and give the output.

Code-2 with functions :
-----------------------
 def hello_world():
     print("Hello good morning")
hello_world()  # It'll call the function, Then it will execute the code inside the function.
