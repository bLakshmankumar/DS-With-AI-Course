Agenda : Anaconda installation process and some of the important packages in python for DS:
============================================================================================
   Meaning of Anaconda :
   --------------------
      Anaconda is an open-source software that contains Jupyter, spyder, etc that are used for large data processing, data analytics, heavy scientific computing. 
      Anaconda works for R and python programming language. Spyder(sub-application of Anaconda) is used for python. Opencv for python will work in spyder. 
      Package versions are managed by the package management system called conda.

   Anaconda installation process : 
   ------------------------------- 
      To begin working with Anaconda, one must get it installed first. Follow the below instructions to Download and install Anaconda on your system:
      > Folllow this Doc : https://freelearning.anaconda.cloud/get-started-with-anaconda/18199 
         > Switched to this site : https://www.anaconda.com/download/success 
         > Choose Your OS : I am choose downlod option for windows.
         > Once Download is complete
         > Go to download path open the anaconda installer, Click on next, next until finish.

# Important packages in python for DS :
=======================================
     # Packages for EDA : Explodatory data analysis :
     -------------------------------------------------
        > NUMPY  : (Numarical Python)
        > Pandas : (Used for database operations) Like reading the data, writting the data, analyse the data all the thing is called pandas data framework.
        > Matplotlib : (This is for Plotting)
        > Seaborn and bokhe : ( This is also a plotting package only) and There are so many plotting packages are there.
    
     # Packages for ML : Machine Learning :
     --------------------------------------
        > sickit-learn : (sklearn) : In python This is a very very famous package as of today, No other alterative package is availble for this. No one is still not beat this package. 
        > MLlib : (ML-Library) : This is related to pyspark. 
     {NOTE: Python and pyspark both are programming langauges and both are look like same, And Python used by DataScientists, And pyspark is used by Data Engineers}.

     # Packages for Deep-Learning applications:
     ------------------------------------------
        > tensorflow : (Introduced by google)
        > keras      : {Tensorflow and keras both packages are work together, Keras is a backend of tensorflow}.
        > pytorch    : PyTorch is an open-source deep learning framework developed by Facebook's AI Research lab (FAIR). It provides a flexible and efficient platform for building and training neural networks and other machine learning models.
        > Opencv     : OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is a popular open-source library for computer vision and image processing tasks in Python and other programming languages. 
                       It provides a wide range of functionalities, including image and video manipulation, object detection and tracking, face detection, image filtering, geometric transformations, and machine learning support for computer vision tasks.

     # Packages for NLP :
     --------------------
        > nltk : (Natural Language tool kit) : 
        > Scipy : SciPy is a Python library used for scientific and technical computing. SciPy is invaluable for anyone working with scientific computing in Python, providing robust tools and algorithms to solve complex mathematical problems efficiently.

     # BERT MODELS :
     ---------------
       > transformers : BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) models are a type of transformer-based neural network architecture designed for natural language processing (NLP). 
                        They are pre-trained on large amounts of textual data using unsupervised learning techniques to learn deep bidirectional representations of language. 
                        These representations can then be fine-tuned with labeled data to achieve state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of NLP tasks such as text classification, question answering, and named entity recognition.
     # Other packages :
     ==================
       # Azure ML packages, # Chatgpt Packages, # Flask, # Streamlit and etc.
