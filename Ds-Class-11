Sample python code practice :
=============================
 1) Requirement :
 ================
    # Writa a program ask the user to enter the basic salary, Then
    #                 ask the user to enter the DA amount, Then
    #                 ask the user to enter the HRA amount, Then
    # Calculate_total_pay= Basic_salary+DA+HRA.

  # Solution :
  ============
    basic_salary=eval(input("enter a basic_salry: "))
    DA=eval(input("enter DA amount: "))
    HRA=eval(input("enter HRA amount: "))
    total_pay=basic_salary+DA+HRA
    print("the total salary is: ",total_pay)

 # Explanation :
 ===============
        The user inputs their basic salary, DA, and HRA.
        The code converts these inputs to numbers.
        It then calculates the total salary by adding these numbers together.
        Finally, it prints the total salary.
    Uses eval() to evaluate the string input, converting it to a number (integer or float).
    Uses input() to get the user's input as a string.

 # Suggestion :
 ==============
   Note: Using eval() can be risky because it will evaluate any string as code. It's safer to use float(input()) or int(input()) instead, depending on whether you expect decimals or whole numbers.
