Sample python code practice :
=============================
 1) Requirement-1 :
 ================
    # Writa a program ask the user to enter the basic salary, Then
    #                 ask the user to enter the DA amount, Then
    #                 ask the user to enter the HRA amount, Then
    # Calculate_total_pay= Basic_salary+DA+HRA.

   # Solution :
   ============
     basic_salary=eval(input("enter a basic_salry: "))
     DA=eval(input("enter DA amount: "))
     HRA=eval(input("enter HRA amount: "))
     total_pay=basic_salary+DA+HRA
     print("the total salary is: ",total_pay)   : (Shift+Enter) > provide the inputs and it'll give the answer

   # Explanation :
   ===============
        The user inputs their basic salary, DA, and HRA.
        The code converts these inputs to numbers.
        It then calculates the total salary by adding these numbers together.
        Finally, it prints the total salary.
    Uses eval() to evaluate the string input, converting it to a number (integer or float).
    Uses input() to get the user's input as a string.

   # Suggestion :
   ==============
     Note: Using eval() can be risky because it will evaluate any string as code. It's safer to use float(input()) or int(input()) instead, depending on whether you expect decimals or whole numbers.

2) Requirement-2 :
 ================
    # Writa a program ask the user to enter the basic salary, Then
    #                 ask the user to enter the tax percentage, Then
    #                 calculate how much tax the user needs to pay

   # Solution :
   ============
     # Ask the user to enter the basic salary
     basic_salary = float(input("Enter the basic salary: "))     # Prompts the user to enter the basic salary.

     # Ask the user to enter the tax percentage
     tax_percentage = float(input("Enter the tax percentage: "))  # Prompts the user to enter the tax percentage.

     # Calculate the tax amount
     tax_amount = (basic_salary * tax_percentage) / 100           # Calculates the tax amount by multiplying the basic salary by the tax percentage and then dividing by 100.

     # Print the tax amount
     print("The tax amount to be paid is: ", tax_amount)   : (Shift+Enter) > provide the inputs and it'll Prints the calculated tax amount.

   # Note :
   ========
      Uses input() to get the user's input as a string.
      Converts the string input to a floating-point number using float().

3) Requirement-3 :
==================
   #  Writa a program ask the user to get a random value between 1 and 100
   #  Perform the square of the number
   #  Package Name : random
   #  Method Name  : randint

  # Solution : 
  ============
    import random
    number=random.randint(1,100) #computer will generate a number between 1,100 and it'll save it in number.
    square=number*number
    print("the square of {} is {}".format(number,square))       : (Shift+Enter) > it'll give the random Output.
  # Note :
  ========
    What is the use of random.randint function in practical ?  : statistics.

 4) Requirement-4 :
 ==================
   # Write a program ask user the enter a distance 
   # Ask user enter a rate per distance 
   # Calculate the charge

   # Solution-1 :
   ============
     distance = float(input("Enter the distance: "))                     # Ask the user to enter the distance
     rate_per_distance = float(input("Enter the rate per distance: "))   # Ask the user to enter the rate per distance
     charge = distance * rate_per_distance                               # Calculates the total charge by multiplying the distance by the rate per distance.
     print("The total charge is: ", charge) : (Shift+Enter) > it'll give the random Output. 

   # Solution-2 :
   ==============
     distance = eval(input("enter distance in km:"))
     rate = eval(input("enter rate per km:"))
     charge = distance * rate
     print("for {} km the charge is {} rs".format(distance, charge)).

 5) Requirement-4 : (Example of interaction)
 ===========================================
    # ask the user to enter total bill in dollars: 100
    # manager: the dollars are not accepted
    # user: what will be accepted
    # manager: only Indian rupees
    # ask the user to enter one dollar is equal to how many rupees: 80
    # calculate total bill in Indian rupees
    # print the total bill in Indian rupees 
    # manager: Thank you!

    # Solution-1 :
    ==============
      total_bill_dollars = eval(input("Enter total bill in dollars: "))
      print("Manager: The dollars are not accepted")
      print("User: What will be accepted?") 
      print("Manager: Only Indian rupees")
      conversion_rate = eval(input("Enter one dollar is equal to how many rupees: ")) 
      total_bill_rupees = total_bill_dollars * conversion_rate
      print("Total bill in Indian Rupees: ", total_bill_rupees)
      print("Manager: Thank you!")

    # Solution-2 :
    ==============
      a = eval(input("Enter total bill in dollars: "))
      print("Manager: The dollars are not accepted!")
      print("User: What will be accepted?")
      print("Manager: Only Indian rupees")
      b = eval(input("Enter one dollar is equal to how many rupees: "))
      c = a * b
      print("Total amount in Rs is {} rs".format(c))  : Output is Total amount you need to pay in Rs is 10 rs
      Other-print-statement :  
      print("Total amount is {} dollers, you need to pay in Rs is {} rs".format(a,c)) : Output : Total amount is 5 dollers, you need to pay in Rs is 10 rs

    # Solution-3 (With time sleep) :
    ================================
      import time                                           # import time: This imports the time module, which provides various time-related functions.
      a = eval(input("Enter total bill in dollars: "))  
      time.sleep(2)                                         # time.sleep(2): This makes the program pause or sleep for 2 seconds before executing the next line of code.
      print("Manager: The dollars are not accepted!")
      time.sleep(2)
      print("User: What will be accepted?")
      time.sleep(2)
      print("Manager: Only Indian rupees")
      time.sleep(2)
      b = eval(input("Enter one dollar is equal to how many rupees: "))
      time.sleep(2)
      c = a * b
      time.sleep(1)
      print("Total amount in Rs is {} rs".format(c))

    NOTE : 
    ======
      import time: This imports the time module, which provides various time-related functions.
      time.sleep(2): This makes the program pause or sleep for 2 seconds before executing the next line of code.

    # Solution-4 : [Instead of using print statement, if you want to take request from user, Then give the response to user manually, we can use input statements]
    ==============
      Bill = eval(input("Manager: Enter the total bill in dollars: "))            # Prompts the user to enter the total bill amount in dollars and Stores the input value in the variable Bill.
      manager_response = input("Manager:The dollars are not accepted! ")          # Prompts the user to input the manager's response to the bill amount and Stores the input value in the variable Manager_Response_1.
      #time.sleep(2)
      user_response = input("User: What will be accepted? ")                      # Prompts the user to input the user's response to the manager's statement and Stores the input value in the variable User_Response_2
      #time.sleep(2)
      manager_response_2 = input("Manager: ")
      #time.sleep(2)
      b = eval(input("Manager: Enter one dollar is equal to how many rupees: "))
      #time.sleep(2)
      c = a * b
      #time.sleep(1)
      #final_response = input("Manager: Total amount in Rs is {c} rs ")             
      print("Total amount in Rs is {} rs".format(c))     

                 (OR)
      Bill = eval(input("Manager: Enter the total bill in dollars: "))            
      input("Manager:The dollars are not accepted! ")          
      #time.sleep(2)
      input("User_response: What will be accepted? ")                     
      input("Manager_response: ")
      #time.sleep(2)
      CR=eval(input("Doller conversion: "))
      Total=Bill * CR
      print("The total amount is:", Total)
     
    Note : 
    ======
      "Input" in Python is used to get input from the user, while "print" is used to display output to the user. input pauses the program and waits for the user to type something, whereas print simply shows a message or data on the screen.
      Also We can use input and print statements in Python together in scenarios where you want to take user input and immediately provide some output or feedback based on that input.
      Example :
      =========
           # Taking user input for their name
             name = input("Enter your name: ")
           # Printing a greeting message
             print(f"Hello, {name}!")

  6) Requirement-6 :
  ==================
     # Father and Son story
     # Father : Which course you want to do
     # Son : I want to pursue DS course
     # Father : That's very nice !
     # Father : May i know your EMCET/JEE Rank
     # Son    : It's 200000
     # Father : How an you pursue
     # Son  : Through payment seat
     # Father : Which college is offering 
     # Son : Naresh It
     # Father : How much is the fee
     # Son : 20000 rs for semisters
     # Father : How many sem
     # Son : Total sem
     # Father : how much is the Total
     # Son : 80,000

  # Code-for-this-requirement : 
  =============================
     import time
     Father = input("Father: ")
     Son    = input("Son: ")
     time.sleep(2)
     print("Father: that's very nice: ")
     print(" Father: May i know your EMCET/JEE Rank ")
     Son = input("Son: ")
     time.sleep(2)
     print("Father: How you pursue")
     time.sleep(1)
     print("Son: Through payment seat")
     time.sleep(1)
     print("Father: Which college is offering: ")
     time.sleep(1)
     Son = input("Son: ")
     time.sleep(1)
     print("Father : How much is the fee: ")
     sem_fee = float(input("Provide the fee for each semister: "))    # Convert to float
     time.sleep(1)
     print("Father : How many sem")
     toatl_semisters = int(input("Son: Total sem are: "))             # Convert to int
     time.sleep(2)
     print("Father : how much is the Total")
     total = sem_fee * toatl_semisters                                # Perform the multiplication with numerical types
     print("total semisters fees {} rs".format(total))

  NOTE : 
  ======
     By default, input() returns a string. If we don't convert these strings, Python will attempt to perform operations on strings instead of numbers.
     For example :
     ============
        sem_fee = input("Provide the fee for each semester: ")  # sem_fee is a string
        total_semesters = input("Son: Total semesters are: ")  # total_semesters is a string
        total = sem_fee * total_semesters  # This will cause an error

     Errors Without Conversion :
     ===========================
       If we don't convert the inputs, We may get a TypeError : 
           TypeError: can't multiply sequence by non-int of type 'str'
      [This error indicates that Python cannot perform multiplication between two strings or a string and a non-integer type.]

Assignment :
============
   1.	Ask the user to enter a number. Print out the square of the number, 
      Sample output is shown below.
      Enter a number: 5 The square of 5 is 25.
     Solution : [Square of a Number]
     ==========
            number = float(input("Enter a number: "))
            square = number * number
            print(f"The square of {number} is {square}.")

   2.	Ask the user to enter a number x. print out x, 2x, 3x, 4x, and 5x, each separated by three dashes, like below.
       Enter a number: 7 7---14---21---28---35
      Solution : [Multiples of a Number]
      ==========
        x = float(input("Enter a number: "))
        multiples = f"{x}---{2*x}---{3*x}---{4*x}---{5*x}"
        print(multiples)

   3.	Write a program that asks the user for a weight in kilograms and converts it to pounds. There are 2.2 pounds in a kilogram.
      Solution : [Convert Kilograms to Pounds]
      ==========
         kilograms = float(input("Enter weight in kilograms: "))
         pounds = kilograms * 2.2
         print(f"{kilograms} kilograms is equal to {pounds} pounds.")

   4.	Write a program that asks the user to enter three numbers (use three separate input statements). Create variables called total and average that hold the sum and average of the three numbers and print out the values of total and average.
      Solution : [Sum and Average of Three Numbers]
      ==========
        num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
        num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))
        num3 = float(input("Enter the third number: "))

        total = num1 + num2 + num3
        average = total / 3

        print(f"The total of the three numbers is {total}.")
        print(f"The average of the three numbers is {average}.")

   5.	A lot of cell phones have tip calculators. Write one. Ask the user for the price of the meal and the percent tip they want to leave. Then print both the tip amount and the total bill with the tip included.
      Solution : [Tip Calculator]
      ==========
        meal_price = float(input("Enter the price of the meal: "))
        tip_percent = float(input("Enter the percent tip you want to leave: "))

        tip_amount = meal_price * (tip_percent / 100)
        total_bill = meal_price + tip_amount

        print(f"The tip amount is {tip_amount}.")
        print(f"The total bill with tip is {total_bill}.")

   [ These scripts will prompt the user for input, perform the required calculations, and print the results accordingly ].
