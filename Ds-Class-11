Sample python code practice :
=============================
 1) Requirement-1 :
 ================
    # Writa a program ask the user to enter the basic salary, Then
    #                 ask the user to enter the DA amount, Then
    #                 ask the user to enter the HRA amount, Then
    # Calculate_total_pay= Basic_salary+DA+HRA.

   # Solution :
   ============
     basic_salary=eval(input("enter a basic_salry: "))
     DA=eval(input("enter DA amount: "))
     HRA=eval(input("enter HRA amount: "))
     total_pay=basic_salary+DA+HRA
     print("the total salary is: ",total_pay)   : (Shift+Enter) > provide the inputs and it'll give the answer

   # Explanation :
   ===============
        The user inputs their basic salary, DA, and HRA.
        The code converts these inputs to numbers.
        It then calculates the total salary by adding these numbers together.
        Finally, it prints the total salary.
    Uses eval() to evaluate the string input, converting it to a number (integer or float).
    Uses input() to get the user's input as a string.

   # Suggestion :
   ==============
     Note: Using eval() can be risky because it will evaluate any string as code. It's safer to use float(input()) or int(input()) instead, depending on whether you expect decimals or whole numbers.

2) Requirement-2 :
 ================
    # Writa a program ask the user to enter the basic salary, Then
    #                 ask the user to enter the tax percentage, Then
    #                 calculate how much tax the user needs to pay

   # Solution :
   ============
     # Ask the user to enter the basic salary
     basic_salary = float(input("Enter the basic salary: "))     # Prompts the user to enter the basic salary.

     # Ask the user to enter the tax percentage
     tax_percentage = float(input("Enter the tax percentage: "))  # Prompts the user to enter the tax percentage.

     # Calculate the tax amount
     tax_amount = (basic_salary * tax_percentage) / 100           # Calculates the tax amount by multiplying the basic salary by the tax percentage and then dividing by 100.

     # Print the tax amount
     print("The tax amount to be paid is: ", tax_amount)   : (Shift+Enter) > provide the inputs and it'll Prints the calculated tax amount.

   # Note :
   ========
      Uses input() to get the user's input as a string.
      Converts the string input to a floating-point number using float().

3) Requirement-3 :
==================
   #  Writa a program ask the user to get a random value between 1 and 100
   #  Perform the square of the number
   #  Package Name : random
   #  Method Name  : randint

  # Solution : 
  ============
    import random
    number=random.randint(1,100) #computer will generate a number between 1,100 and it'll save it in number.
    square=number*number
    print("the square of {} is {}".format(number,square))       : (Shift+Enter) > it'll give the random Output.
  # Note :
  ========
    What is the use of random.randint function in practical ?  : statistics.

 4) Requirement-4 :
 ==================
   # Write a program ask user the enter a distance 
   # Ask user enter a rate per distance 
   # Calculate the charge

   # Solution-1 :
   ============
     distance = float(input("Enter the distance: "))                     # Ask the user to enter the distance
     rate_per_distance = float(input("Enter the rate per distance: "))   # Ask the user to enter the rate per distance
     charge = distance * rate_per_distance                               # Calculates the total charge by multiplying the distance by the rate per distance.
     print("The total charge is: ", charge) : (Shift+Enter) > it'll give the random Output. 

   # Solution-2 :
   ==============
     distance = eval(input("enter distance in km:"))
     rate = eval(input("enter rate per km:"))
     charge = distance * rate
     print("for {} km the charge is {} rs".format(distance, charge)).

 5) Requirement-4 : (Example of interaction)
 ===========================================
    # ask the user to enter total bill in dollars: 100
    # manager: the dollars are not accepted
    # user: what will be accepted
    # manager: only Indian rupees
    # ask the user to enter one dollar is equal to how many rupees: 80
    # calculate total bill in Indian rupees
    # print the total bill in Indian rupees 
    # manager: Thank you!

    # Solution-1 :
    ==============
      total_bill_dollars = eval(input("Enter total bill in dollars: "))
      print("Manager: The dollars are not accepted")
      print("User: What will be accepted?") 
      print("Manager: Only Indian rupees")
      conversion_rate = eval(input("Enter one dollar is equal to how many rupees: ")) 
      total_bill_rupees = total_bill_dollars * conversion_rate
      print("Total bill in Indian Rupees: ", total_bill_rupees)
      print("Manager: Thank you!")

    # Solution-2 :
    ==============
      a = eval(input("Enter total bill in dollars: "))
      print("Manager: The dollars are not accepted!")
      print("User: What will be accepted?")
      print("Manager: Only Indian rupees")
      b = eval(input("Enter one dollar is equal to how many rupees: "))
      c = a * b
      print("Total amount in Rs is {} rs".format(c))
