What is mean by Variables :
===========================
  Variables in Python store key-value pairs where the variable name is the key and the assigned value is the value. 
  Variable names must start with a letter or an underscore, followed by letters, numbers, or underscores. 
  They are case-sensitive and can't use reserved keywords.
Rules to define variables :
===========================
  valid_name = "Alice"  # Valid
  _name2 = 42           # Valid
  Valid_Number=200      # Valid
  sum=700               # Valid [Note: sum is works for math operations, But never use "sum" as a variable even it's working]
  Valid_name%=200       # Invalid
  Valid name=300        # Invalid [we shouldn't use space in between]
  if=500                # Invalid (It won't allow the keywords to set as variables){like: is,if,and...etc}.
  2cool4school = "No"   # Invalid (starts with a number)
  class = "Physics"     # Invalid (reserved keyword)

Data-types :
============
  In computer programming, data types specify the type of data that can be stored inside a variable.
   Data Types	              Classes	                Description
    Numeric	           int, float, complex	   holds numeric values
    String	                str	               holds sequence of characters
   Sequence	           list, tuple, range   	 holds collection of items
   Mapping	               dict	               holds data in key-value pair form
   Boolean	               bool	               holds either True or False
     Set	             set, frozenset        	 hold collection of unique items

Examples :
==========
 1) Numeric (int, float, complex): Holds numeric values :
       age = 30                  # int
       temperature = 19.99       # float
       complex_num = 3 + 4j      # complex
 2) String (str): Holds sequence of characters :
       name = "Alice"            # str
 3) Sequence (list, tuple, range): Holds collection of items :
       fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]  # list
       point = (10, 20)                        # tuple
       numbers = range(1, 10)                  # range
 4) Mapping (dict): Holds data in key-value pair form :
       student = {"name": "Alice", "age": 21}  # dict
 5) Boolean (bool): Holds either True or False :
       is_active = True         # bool
 6) Set (set, frozenset): Holds collection of unique items :
       unique_numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}  # set
       frozen_numbers = frozenset([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])  # frozenset




How to check the Python data type :
==================================
   There’s a built-in function called type which you can use to check data types in Python. Let’s look at some examples of type at work:
     >>> type(3)
       <class 'int'>
     >>> type('hello')
       <class 'str'>
     >>> type([1,2,3])
       <class 'list'>

Devided python into 3 parts :
=============================
 Level-1 :
 =========
   1) Basic syntax
   2) Variables
   3) Python packages information
   4) Basic python code
   5) Conditional statements
   6) Functions
   7) Looping

 Level-2 :
 =========
   1) Strings
   2) List
   3) Dictionary
   4) tuples
   5) Sets
   6) File handling sessions.
