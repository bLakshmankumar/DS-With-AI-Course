# Error Handling :
==================
As developer writting a code without an errors are very important, So today we will make some mistakes and will find, what errors we will getting.
 1) This below code is the correct code without any issues, It'll do addtion of num1 and num2.
     num1=eval(input("enter a number one: "))
     num2=eval(input("enter a number two: "))
     add=num1+num2  
     print(add) : output = num1(2)+num2(2) =4.

    Let's start the modifications here :
    ------------------------------------
    Error-1 :
    =========
      Instead of doing addition with num1+num2 I mistakenly do addtion with num3(which we not defined on the above code)        
        add=num1+num3 [Error: NameError: name 'number3' is not defined]
      Why we are getting this error , Because we didn't define the num3 variable. If you want fix please review the code and add the required code changes.
