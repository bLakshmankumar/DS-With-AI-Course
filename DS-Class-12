# Error Handling :
==================
As developer writting a code without an errors are very important, So today we will make some mistakes and will find, what errors we will getting.
 1) This below code is the correct code without any issues, It'll do addtion of num1 and num2.
     num1=eval(input("enter a number one: "))
     num2=eval(input("enter a number two: "))
     add=num1+num2  
     print(add) : output = num1(2)+num2(2) =4.

    Let's start the modifications here :
    ------------------------------------
    Error-1 : [Name-Error]
    ======================
      Instead of doing addition with num1+num2 I mistakenly do addtion with num3(which we not defined on the above code)        
        add=num1+num3 [Error: NameError: name 'number3' is not defined]
      Why we are getting this error :
      -------------------------------
        Because we didn't define the num3 variable. If you want fix this, please verify is that variable(num3) is defined on your code or not ?

    Error-2 : [Syntax-Error]
    ========================
     I intentionnaly remove the end bracket and will see what error we will get.
       num1=eval(input("enter a number one: ") & Run the code
       Error-Code : SyntaxError: '(' was never closed.
       Fix : Verify the syntax of your code, And add the correct synstax and run : num1=eval(input("enter a number one: "))

   Error-3 : [ZeroDivision-Error]
   ==============================
         number1=eval(input("enter a number one: "))
         number2=eval(input("enter a number two: "))
         add=number1/number2
         print(add) & run the code
       Inputs:
         enter a number one:  100
         enter a number two:  0
       
       Error :
       -------
          "ZeroDivisionError: division by zero"
       
       Why This error we will get :
       ----------------------------
          This ZeroDivisionError, which occurs when you try to divide a number by zero. 
          The traceback indicates that the error happened on the line where we perform the division
          Python tries to compute 100/0, but since division by zero is not defined, Python raises a ZeroDivisionError.
   
       Example-scenario-for-this-error: 
       --------------------------------
         a) Basic Concept of Division:
         -----------------------------
             Division is like splitting something into equal parts. For example, if you have 10 apples and want to share them equally among 2 friends, each friend gets 5 apples.
         b) Division by Zero:
         --------------------
             Now, imagine you want to divide 10 apples among 0 friends. Since there are no friends to share the apples with, it doesn’t make sense.You can’t divide something if there’s no one to receive it.
             In mathematical terms, dividing by zero doesn’t produce a meaningful or defined result. It’s like trying to answer “How many times does 0 fit into 10?” There’s no answer because dividing by zero breaks the rules of arithmetic.
