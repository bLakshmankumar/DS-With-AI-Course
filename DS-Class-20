Requirement -1 [Nov-6]
===============
# Wap to print hello 3 times/iterations using Loop
# don't do
# print ('hello')
# print ('hello')
# print ('hello') in 3 times what is my requirement is, use a single print statement that should run 3 times
Code-1 :
========
for i in range(3): # This 3 means how many times we want to execute/run our code. 
    print ('hello')
Output : 
========
hello
hello
hello

Code-2 :
========
 for i in range(1, 4): # This 1,4  The loop prints "hello" 3 times, as the range(1, 4) creates a sequence that includes the numbers 1, 2, and 3.
    print ('hello')
Output : 
========
hello
hello
hello

Let's do another code :
========================
Code-3 :
========
print ('Hai')
for i in range(3):
    print("Hello")
print("How do you do") 

Output :
========
Python is a step by step process so it'll print the output as a sequence. 
Hai
Hello
Hello
Hello
How do you do 

# Requirement-2 :
# -------------
# I want to print the output in this order
# A
# A
# A
# B
# B
# C
# C
# C

Code-4 :
========
 for i in range(3):
    print("A")
for i in range(2):
    print("B")
for i in range(3):
    print("C")

Output :
========
# A
# A
# A
# B
# B
# C
# C
# C
 (OR)
Code-5
======
# Outer loop for letters
for letter, count in [('A', 3), ('B', 2), ('C', 3)]:
    # Inner loop to print each letter the specified number of times
    for _ in range(count):
        print(letter)
# The outer loop iterates through a list of tuples. Each tuple contains a letter and the number of times it should be printed.
# The inner loop prints the letter as many times as specified in the tuple.
Output :
========
A
A
A
B
B
C
C
C

Requirement-3 :
===============
# Wap ask the user to get the square of the numbers
# Between 10 to 15
# Square of 10 is 100
# Square of 11 is 121
# Square of 12 is 144

Code 
======
# Python program to print the square of numbers between 10 and 15 using a loop.
# First should get the numbers from 10 to 15
for number in range(10, 16):
    square = number * number
    print(f"Square of {number} is {square}")
Output : 
========
Square of 10 is 100
Square of 11 is 121
Square of 12 is 144
Square of 13 is 169
Square of 14 is 196
Square of 15 is 225

# Requirement-4 : 
=================
Use the same above requirement but this time take the inputs from the user.
And do the calculation part.
Code :
======
# Ask the user for the starting and ending numbers
start = eval(input("Enter the starting number: "))
end = eval(input("Enter the ending number: "))

# Loop through the given range and print squares
for number in range(start, end):
    square = number * number
    print(f"Square of {number} is {square}")

Output:
=======
Enter the starting number:  10
Enter the ending number:  15
Square of 10 is 100
Square of 11 is 121
Square of 12 is 144
Square of 13 is 169
Square of 14 is 196
Square of 15 is 225

Requirement-5 :
===============
I want to use the same above code but i want to save the values in a variables and call the variables.
Code : 
======
# Set the variables
start = 10
end = 15

# Loop through the given range and print squares
for number in range(start, end):
    square = number * number
    print(f"Square of {number} is {square}")

Requirement-6 :
===============
I want to use the same code with functions using "without arguments".
code :
======
# define a function 
def square1():
# Ask the user for the starting and ending numbers
  start = int(input("Enter the starting number: "))
  end = int(input("Enter the ending number: "))

# Write a for Loop through the given range and print squares
  for number in range(start, end):
      square = number * number
      print(f"Square of {number} is {square}")
square1() # call the function

Output :
=======
Enter the starting number:  10
Enter the ending number:  12
Square of 10 is 100
Square of 11 is 121

Requirement-7:
==============
I want to use the same code with functions using "with arguments".
Code-1 :
========
# Define a function with arguments
def square_with_range(start, end):
    # Use a loop to print squares from start to end (inclusive)
    for number in range(start, end + 1):
        square = number * number
        print(f"Square of {number} is {square}")

# Call the function with arguments
square_with_range(10, 15)


Code-2 :
=======
# Using variables with a function that has arguments.

def square_with_range(start, end):
    # Use a loop to print squares from start to end (inclusive)
    for number in range(start, end + 1):
        square = number * number
        print(f"Square of {number} is {square}")
# Define variables
start_number = 10
end_number = 15

# Call the function using variables
square_with_range(start_number, end_number)

# Requirement-6 :
=================
#Wap ask the user to print square of the five numbers
#and these five numbers you need to ask user everytime

Code-1 :
# Loop 5 times to get 5 numbers from the user
for i in range(5):
    number = eval(input(f"Enter number {i + 1}: "))
    square = number * number
    print(f"Square of {number} is {square}")
Output :
========
Enter number 1:  1
Square of 1 is 1
Enter number 2:  5
Square of 5 is 25
Enter number 3:  6
Square of 6 is 36
Enter number 4:  4
Square of 4 is 16
Enter number 5:  5
Square of 5 is 25

Code-2 :
========
for i in range(5):
    num = eval(input(f"Enter number : "))
    print("The square of {} is {}".format(num, num*num))
What it does:
============
  Loops 5 times.
  Each time, asks the user to enter a number.
  Prints the square of that number.
Purpose
