# Wap to print hello 3 times/iterations using Loop
# don't do
# print ('hello')
# print ('hello')
# print ('hello') in 3 times what is my requirement is, use a single print statement that should run 3 times
Code-1 :
========
for i in range(3): # This 3 means how many times we want to execute/run our code. 
    print ('hello')
Output : 
========
hello
hello
hello

Code-2 :
========
 for i in range(1, 4): # This 1,4  The loop prints "hello" 3 times, as the range(1, 4) creates a sequence that includes the numbers 1, 2, and 3.
    print ('hello')
Output : 
========
hello
hello
hello

Let's do another code :
========================
print ('Hai')
for i in range(3):
    print("Hello")
print("How do you do") 

Output :
========
Python is a step by step process so it'll print the output as a sequence. 
Hai
Hello
Hello
Hello
How do you do
