# Conditional Statements : 
==========================
  # Meaning of conditional statements :
  =====================================
      Conditional statements in Python allow you to execute certain blocks of code based on whether a condition is true or false. They are essential for decision-making in programming.
  # Basic Syntax :
  ================
   1 ) if Statement:
   ------------------
       Used to test a specific condition. [It'll give either true/false] 
       If the condition is true, the block of code inside the if statement is executed.
       If the condition is false, the block of code is skipped.
   2) else Statement:
   ------------------
      Used to execute a block of code if the condition in the if statement is false.
      It provides an alternative set of instructions.
  3) elif Statement (short for "else if"):
  ----------------------------------------
      Used to check multiple conditions.
      If the previous conditions are false, it checks the next condition.

  How if - else - elseif statements will works :
  =============================================
     if condition is statisfy "if block code" will execute, 
     if conddition is not satisfy in the "if block" then "else block code" will exceute. 
     But If the previous conditions are false, it checks the next condition.

  Note : Whenever we see/provide condition means, Python will check whether the condition is True or False. If the condition is true, the block of code inside the if statement is executed. If the condition is false, the block of code is skipped.

# Some Example codes for these conditional statements : 
=======================================================
    Example-code-1 :
    ================
      name='python'          # This = means we are assigning some value to the variable(name). ["=" measn assign value to the key/varible] : Here we assigning/saved the value "python" as a string to the variable called "name".
      if name == 'python':   # Here == means we are comparing/validate the value is matching to the varible value which we defined on above. ["==" means condition]
         print('Yes-True')
      else:
        print('no-false')
    Execute this code : If name == python it'll print Yes-True statemet, else it'll print the no-false statement.

    Example-code-2 :
    ================
      sa_won = 'won'      # Change this value to test different conditions
      if sa_won:
            print("SA will go to the final")
      else:
            print("India will go to the final")

    Example-code-3 : 
    ================
      True Case :
      ===========
      name='python'         # This = means we are assigning some value to the variable(name). ["=" measn assign value to the key/varible] : Here we assigning/saved the value "python" as a string to the variable called "name".
      if name == 'python':  # Here it'll verify the condition, If condition is true then it'll excute the "code which is provided on the if block", If condition is not true then it'll exceute the "code which is available on the else statement"
         a=10
         b=20
         print(a+b)         # if name == python then it'll exceute this piece of code, otherwise(else) it'll move to the else statement.
      else:
        print('no-false')
         Output : 30        # We provide the correct condition in if statement, So the output is 30.

      False-Case :
      ============
      name='python'        
      if name == 'Py':      # Instead of providing the actual value "I provided the Fasle value as Py" , It'll not execute the code available in if statement, It will directly exceute the else statement only. 
         a=10
         b=20
         print(a+b)         # if name == python then it'll exceute this piece of code, otherwise(else) it'll move to the else statement.
      else:
        print('False')  :   # We provide the incorrect condition in if statement, So it give Output as a False.

    Example-code-4 :
    ================
      print('hello')                                          # This prints "hello" 
      print(10)                                               # This prints "10" 
      num1 = int(input("Enter a number1: "))                  # The program prompts the user to enter two numbers and The input() function reads the input from the user as a string and int() converts the string input to an integer.
      num2 = int(input("Enter a number2: "))                  # The entered values are stored in num1 and num2.
      if num1 == num2:                                        # The program checks if num1 is equal to num2 and If the condition is true, It'll perform the below actions.
          print("This is the True case")
          print("We are doing an addition operation")
          print("The addition of {} and {} is: {}".format(num1, num2, num1 + num2))
          print("Happy ending!")
      else:                                                  # If the condition is false (the numbers are not equal), the following happens:
          print("This is the False case")                    # Prints "This is the False case".
          print("We are doing multiplication")               # Prints "We are doing multiplication".
          print("The multiplication of {} and {} is: {}".format(num1, num2, num1 * num2)) # Calculates the product of num1 and num2 and prints it using formatted strings.
          subtraction = num1 - num2                          # Calculates the difference (subtraction) of num1 and num2 and prints it.
          print("Subtraction:", subtraction)                 # Prints the substraction value
          print("Great!")                                    # Prints "Great!".
    
    Example-code-5 :
    ================
      #  Write a program to ask the user enter a number
      # find the number is even or odd number
      # eve number: if you divide with 2 the reminder is zero
      # odd number
      # In python modulus opertor gives remainder
    Code :
    ======
     # Ask the user to enter a number
       number = int(input("Enter a number: "))
     # Check if the number is even or odd
       if number % 2 == 0:                                  # The program uses the modulus operator % to check if the number is even or odd and number % 2 calculates the remainder when number is divided by 2.
       print(f"The number {number} is an even number.")     # If number % 2 == 0, the remainder is 0, meaning the number is even If the remainder is not 0, the number is odd.
       else:
       print(f"The number {number} is an odd number.")
    
# Write the code with condition with try and exception blocks :
===============================================================
    Example-code-6: [Conditions with try and exception blocks]
    ==========================================================
     try:
       number = int(input("Enter a number: "))             # Ask the user to enter a number
       if number % 2 == 0:                                 # Check if the number is even or odd
           print(f"The number {number} is an even number.")
       else:
          print(f"The number {number} is an odd number.")
     except Exception as e:                                 # If you provide input as a float (3.5) it'll redirect to exception block.
         print(e)
            or
         print("Invalid input! Please enter a valid integer.") 

    Example-code-7 :
    ===============
      # Write a program by using "if" "else" and "elseif" statements for below requirements :
      # If SA won the match, they will go to the final.
      # If the match was a draw, it will be replayed.
      # Else, India will go to the final.
    Code :
    ======
     sa_won = False     # Change this value to test different conditions
     match_draw = True  # Change this value to test different conditions
     if sa_won:
        print("SA will go to the final")
     elif match_draw:
        print("The match will be replayed")
     else:
        print("India will go to the final")
